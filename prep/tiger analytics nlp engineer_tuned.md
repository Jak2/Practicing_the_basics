At Nokia, I cleaned data for 25% accuracy gains, applying similar logic (Problem Solving).”

### 3. Behavioral: Tough Technical Challenge
**Answer**: “At Nokia, I automated JIRA reporting to improve defect prioritization (Situation, Problem Framing). Inconsistent text data caused errors (Task). I used Pandas to clean data with groupby() and fillna(), built a tool with JIRA API, and automated Power BI scorecards, saving 2 hours weekly (Action, Root Cause Decomposition). Despite initial API unfamiliarity, I googled solutions and delivered 20% better prioritization (Result, Don’t Need to Know Everything). This problem-solving approach applies to NLP debugging (Problem Solving).”

### 4. Technical: Handle LLM Bias
**Answer**: “I’d decompose bias causes: data, model, or metrics (Root Cause Decomposition). Using Pandas, I’d analyze outputs for demographic skew, retraining with balanced data or debiasing techniques (Bias Detection). For pharma, I’d ensure HIPAA compliance by masking PII (Data Ethics). At Nokia, I fixed data inconsistencies for 25% accuracy gains, a similar approach (Problem Solving). If needed, I’d research tools like Fairlearn, as I did for NLTK (Don’t Need to Know Everything).”
