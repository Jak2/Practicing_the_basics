## 6. Sample Questions and Answers

### Tell Me About Yourself
**Purpose**: Assess background and fit.
**Answer**: “I’m Jayarun, a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience, including 2 years at Nokia, where I automated analytics with Python, like a JIRA tool that improved prioritization by 20% through text analysis (Problem Framing). I’m skilled in Python, SQL, AWS, and Docker, delivering value like 20% faster reports and 25% accuracy gains (Success Metrics). My NLTK and GAN work sparked my passion for NLP, and I’m excited to apply this to Tiger Analytics’ pharma projects, learning GenAI techniques like LoRA (Learn How to Learn). I thrive in collaborative settings, mentoring interns and aligning with stakeholders (You’ll Never Feel Ready).”  
(*Pete’s*: Learn How to Learn, You’ll Never Feel Ready; *Your Points*: Problem Framing, Success Metrics)

### Technical: Design an NLP Pipeline for Clinical Trial Summarization
**Purpose**: Test technical and problem-solving skills.
**Answer**: “I’d frame the goal: summarize trials in 2 hours with 90% accuracy (Problem Framing, Success Metrics). I’d store texts in a Parquet-based data lakehouse with a star schema—fact table for text/predictions, dimensions for trial metadata (Data Modeling, Data Warehousing). Using Python’s NLTK and transformers, I’d preprocess data, fine-tune BioBERT with LoRA, and test for bias (Don’t Need to Know Everything, Bias Detection). I’d deploy via FastAPI on AWS SageMaker, using Docker and CI/CD, monitoring drift with MLflow for retraining (MLOps). For HIPAA/FDA compliance, I’d mask PII with NER (Data Ethics). At Nokia, I cleaned data for 25% accuracy gains, applying similar logic (Problem Solving).”  
(*Pete’s*: Problem Solving, Don’t Need to Know Everything; *Your Points*: Problem Framing, Data Modeling, Data Ethics)

### Behavioral: Tough Technical Challenge
**Purpose**: Evaluate problem-solving and resilience.
**Answer**: “At Nokia, I automated JIRA reporting to improve defect prioritization ( Situation, Problem Framing). Inconsistent text data caused errors (Task). I used Pandas to clean data with groupby() and fillna(), built a tool with JIRA API, and automated Power BI scorecards, saving 2 hours weekly (Action, Root Cause Decomposition). Despite initial API unfamiliarity, I googled solutions and delivered 20% better prioritization (Result, Don’t Need to Know Everything). This approach applies to NLP debugging (Problem Solving).”  
(*Pete’s*: Problem Solving, Don’t Need to Know Everything; *Your Points*: Problem Framing, Root Cause Decomposition)

### Technical: Handle LLM Bias
**Purpose**: Assess GenAI and ethics knowledge.
**Answer**: “I’d decompose bias causes: data, model, or metrics (Root Cause Decomposition). Using Pandas, I’d analyze outputs for demographic skew, retraining with balanced data or debiasing techniques (Bias Detection). For pharma, I’d ensure HIPAA/FDA compliance by masking PII with NER (Data Ethics). At Nokia, I fixed data inconsistencies for 25% accuracy gains, a similar approach (Problem Solving). If needed, I’d research tools like Fairlearn, as I did for NLTK (Don’t Need to Know Everything).”  
(*Pete’s*: Problem Solving, Don’t Need to Know Everything; *Your Points*: Root Cause Decomposition, Bias Detection)

### Behavioral: Ensure Solutions Deliver Business Value
**Purpose**: Test business-oriented thinking.
**Answer**: “I frame problems to align with client goals, like reducing costs (Problem Framing). At Nokia, I built a Power BI dashboard to monitor telecom data health, aiming to cut analysis time (Situation, Task). I collaborated with stakeholders to define KPIs, used Python to clean data, and designed Heat Maps, improving accuracy by 25% and saving 5 hours weekly (Action, User vs Business Value, Success Metrics). I prioritized user-friendly visuals for business value (Result, Revenue Impact). I’d apply this to NLP for pharma, like faster trial analysis (Problem Solving).”  
(*Pete’s*: Nobody Cares About Code, Problem Solving; *Your Points*: Problem Framing, Revenue Impact)
