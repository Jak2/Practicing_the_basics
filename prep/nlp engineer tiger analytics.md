## 2. Technical Preparation

### Key NLP Concepts to Know
Based on the job description, prioritize these:
1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
   - **What**: Pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for tasks like text generation, classification.
   - **Why**: Core to GenAI solutions at Tiger Analytics.
   - **Know**: Basic architecture (transformers), use cases (chatbots, summarization), and challenges (hallucinations, bias).
2. **Fine-Tuning Techniques**:
   - **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Adapts LLMs efficiently by updating a small subset of parameters.
   - **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**: Reduces compute costs for task-specific tuning.
   - **Tip**: Explain why these are useful for pharma (e.g., tailoring models for medical text).
3. **GenAI Challenges**:
   - **Hallucinations**: Models generate false info. Mitigate with grounding or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
   - **Bias**: Models reflect training data biases. Address via data curation or debiasing techniques.
   - **Latency**: Optimize inference with quantization or pruning.
4. **Pharma Domain**:
   - Use cases: Drug discovery, clinical trial analysis, medical record summarization.
   - Tip: Express interest in learning pharma-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA compliance).

### Python and Backend Basics
- **Python**: Be comfortable with libraries like:
  - `transformers` (Hugging Face) for LLMs.
  - `numpy`, `pandas` for data preprocessing.
  - `scikit-learn` for traditional NLP (e.g., TF-IDF).
- **Backend**:
  - **Django/Flask**: Know basics of creating REST APIs to serve models.
  - **APIs**: Understand GET/POST requests and JSON payloads.
  - **Microservices**: Modular services for scalability (e.g., separate model inference and data processing).
- **Tip**: If asked to code, write functional pseudo-code and explain your thought process (Pete’s “problem-solving” lesson).

### MLOps and Deployment Essentials
- **MLOps**: Managing ML lifecycle (training, deployment, monitoring).
  - Tools: MLflow, Kubeflow.
  - Pipelines: CI/CD for model updates (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging models and dependencies.
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (SageMaker), GCP (Vertex AI), Azure (ML Studio).
- **Tip**: Admit limited experience but show eagerness to learn (Pete’s “you’ll never feel ready” lesson).

---

## 3. Behavioral and Problem-Solving Prep

### How to Showcase Problem-Solving
- **Use STAR Method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result):
  - Example: “In a project, I debugged a model’s poor accuracy (S). My task was to improve it for a client demo (T). I analyzed the data, found imbalanced labels, and applied SMOTE oversampling (A). Accuracy improved by 15% (R).”
- **Apply Pete’s Lesson**: Emphasize breaking problems into steps (e.g., “I treated debugging like a detective case, checking data, model, and hyperparameters systematically”).
- **Tip**: Mention googling solutions during projects to normalize it (Pete’s “you don’t need to know everything”).

### Handling Imposter Syndrome and Confidence
- **Mindset**: Pete’s “you’ll never feel ready” applies here. You don’t need to know every tool listed in the job description.
- **Strategy**:
  - Say: “I’ve worked with [tool/technique], and I’m excited to dive deeper into [new tool] based on my learning approach.”
  - Example: “I’ve used Hugging Face for basic LLM tasks and am eager to explore LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.”
- **Tip**: Start answers confidently, even if unsure, and pivot to what you know (Pete’s “start small and grow”).

## 6. Sample Questions and Answers

### Technical Question
**Q**: How would you fine-tune an LLM for a pharma-specific task, like summarizing clinical trial reports?
**A**: “I’d use a pre-trained model like BioBERT, which is tailored for medical text. I’d apply LoRA to fine-tune efficiently, focusing on a dataset of trial reports to adapt the model for summarization. To avoid overfitting, I’d use a validation set and monitor loss. For deployment, I’d wrap the model in a Flask API, ensuring low latency with techniques like quantization. In a past project, I fine-tuned a BERT model for sentiment analysis, improving accuracy by 10% through similar steps.”  
(*Pete’s Lessons*: Problem-solving, Imperfect code, Don’t know everything—focus on steps and admit learning gaps.)

### Behavioral Question
**Q**: Tell me about a time you faced a tough coding challenge.
**A**: “In a hackathon (S), I had to build a chatbot in 12 hours (T). The model kept misclassifying inputs due to noisy data. I analyzed the dataset, applied data cleaning (e.g., removing duplicates), and switched to a simpler transformer model (A). The chatbot achieved 85% accuracy, winning us second place (R). I learned to break problems into steps and Google solutions like ‘text preprocessing’ on the fly.”
