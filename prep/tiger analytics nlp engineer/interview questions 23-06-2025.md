## üìù **Question Name: Sliding Window with Padding**

### **Problem Statement**

You are given a list of tokens and a window size. Your task is to generate all **sliding windows** of the given size by applying **symmetric padding** on both ends of the token list using a specified padding token (`"<PAD>"` by default). This is commonly used in NLP preprocessing to ensure that each token gets a centered window, even those at the edges.

---

### **Function Signature**

```python
def generate_sliding_windows(tokens: List[str], window_size: int, padding_token: str = "<PAD>") -> List[List[str]]:
```

---

### **Input**

* `tokens`: a list of strings (`1 <= len(tokens) <= 1000`)
* `window_size`: an odd integer (`1 <= window_size <= 101`)
* `padding_token`: (optional) a string used for padding. Default is `"<PAD>"`.

---

### **Output**

* A list of lists of strings, where each inner list is a sliding window of size `window_size` from the padded token list.

---

### **Constraints**

* `window_size` will always be odd.
* `padding_token` will be a non-empty string.
* The function should return exactly `len(tokens) + 2 * padding - window_size + 1` windows.

---

### **Sample Input 0**

```python
tokens = ["I", "am", "arun", "from", "India"]
window_size = 3
```

---

### **Sample Output 0**

```python
[
 ['<PAD>', '<PAD>', 'I'],
 ['<PAD>', 'I', 'am'],
 ['I', 'am', 'arun'],
 ['am', 'arun', 'from'],
 ['arun', 'from', 'India'],
 ['from', 'India', '<PAD>'],
 ['India', '<PAD>', '<PAD>']
]
```

---

### **Explanation**

* Padding required on both ends = `window_size // 2 = 1`
* Final padded tokens = `['<PAD>', '<PAD>', 'I', 'am', 'arun', 'from', 'India', '<PAD>', '<PAD>']`
* Windows of size 3 are extracted from the padded list using slicing.

---

## ‚úÖ **Answer Code (Python 3)**

```python
from typing import List

def generate_sliding_windows(tokens: List[str], window_size: int, padding_token: str = "<PAD>") -> List[List[str]]:
    padding = window_size // 2
    padded_tokens = [padding_token] * padding + tokens + [padding_token] * padding
    windows = []

    for i in range(len(tokens) + 2 * padding - window_size + 1):
        window = padded_tokens[i : i + window_size]
        windows.append(window)
    
    return windows
```

# 2nd question
You are designing an object-oriented system for an NLP pipeline in a healthcare domain. How would you use the object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism to design reusable classes for tokenization, text cleaning, and feature extraction?

Certainly! Here's a **theoretical explanation** of how to apply **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** ‚Äî especially **inheritance** and **polymorphism** ‚Äî to design **reusable classes** for an **NLP pipeline in the healthcare domain**.

---

## üìå Problem Context

In the healthcare domain, you often process **clinical notes**, **diagnostic reports**, or **doctor-patient conversations** using **NLP pipelines**. These pipelines typically include stages like:

1. **Text Cleaning** (e.g., removing noise or protected health information)
2. **Tokenization** (e.g., breaking sentences into words or phrases)
3. **Feature Extraction** (e.g., converting text to numerical features for models)

To make these components **reusable**, **modular**, and **extensible**, OOP is ideal.

---

## üß† Key OOP Principles Used

### 1. **Encapsulation**

* Each component of the pipeline (cleaning, tokenization, feature extraction) is wrapped in its own **class**, hiding internal details.
* This makes the code easier to maintain and test.

### 2. **Inheritance**

* You create **base abstract classes** or interfaces (e.g., `Tokenizer`, `TextCleaner`, `FeatureExtractor`).
* Then you implement **specialized subclasses** (e.g., `MedicalTokenizer`, `BasicCleaner`, `TFIDFExtractor`) that inherit from the base.
* This encourages **code reuse** and avoids duplication.

### 3. **Polymorphism**

* Different subclasses can be used **interchangeably** as long as they implement the same interface.
* For example, any class that inherits from `Tokenizer` can be passed into the pipeline ‚Äî the pipeline doesn‚Äôt care *which* tokenizer is used, as long as it follows the expected structure.
* This makes the system **flexible and easily swappable**.

### 4. **Abstraction**

* You define **what** should be done in base classes (e.g., a `tokenize()` method), but not **how** ‚Äî subclasses implement the logic.
* This provides a clean contract and allows for future enhancements without changing existing code.

## ‚úÖ Benefits in the Healthcare NLP Context

| Benefit                     | Explanation                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reusability**             | You can reuse base and subclass components across multiple pipelines.       |
| **Flexibility**             | Swap out components (e.g., use `WhitespaceTokenizer` or `MedicalTokenizer`) |
| **Scalability**             | Add new functionality without rewriting the core system.                    |
| **Domain Adaptability**     | Easily extend base classes for medical-specific needs.                      |
| **Security and Compliance** | Add PHI scrubbing as a cleaning subclass ‚Äî encapsulated and reusable.       |

---

## üîç Example Use Case

Imagine this pipeline:

* A **MedicalCleaner** removes personal health identifiers.
* A **MedicalTokenizer** understands abbreviations like "BP" (Blood Pressure).
* A **TFIDFExtractor** creates features for machine learning.

All of these can inherit from their respective base classes and be assembled into a pipeline using polymorphism.

---

## üì¶ Final Thought

By applying **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, your NLP system becomes:

* Easier to maintain
* More structured
* Ready for complex real-world extensions (like clinical NER, ICD code prediction, etc.)

This object-oriented design **mirrors the modular, plug-and-play architecture** often used in production-level NLP systems.

---

# Explaning in Theory
---
Great question! Designing an object-oriented (OO) system for an NLP pipeline in a healthcare domain demands **clean, reusable, and extendable code**, and this is where **OO principles like inheritance and polymorphism shine**.

---

## üéØ Objective:

To design an NLP pipeline with reusable classes for:

1. **Tokenization**
2. **Text Cleaning**
3. **Feature Extraction**

---

## üß† Key OOP Principles to Use:

| Principle         | How it's Useful Here                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encapsulation** | Keeps logic for each step (e.g., tokenization) in its own class.                           |
| **Inheritance**   | Allows creating specialized classes (e.g., for medical text) based on base behavior.       |
| **Polymorphism**  | Enables using interchangeable classes with the same interface (e.g., multiple tokenizers). |

---

## üß± Design Structure

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Define Base Classes (Interfaces/Abstract Classes)

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TextProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, text: str) -> str:
        pass

class Tokenizer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def tokenize(self, text: str) -> list:
        pass

class FeatureExtractor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def extract_features(self, tokens: list) -> dict:
        pass
```

These are **abstract base classes** ‚Äî they define a contract but don‚Äôt implement the logic.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Implement Concrete Classes Using Inheritance

#### üßº Text Cleaning

```python
class BasicCleaner(TextProcessor):
    def process(self, text: str) -> str:
        return text.lower().replace('\n', ' ').strip()

class MedicalCleaner(TextProcessor):
    def process(self, text: str) -> str:
        text = text.lower().replace('\n', ' ')
        # remove patient IDs or sensitive patterns
        return re.sub(r'\bpid\d+\b', '', text)
```

#### ‚úÇÔ∏è Tokenization

```python
class WhitespaceTokenizer(Tokenizer):
    def tokenize(self, text: str) -> list:
        return text.split()

class MedicalTokenizer(Tokenizer):
    def tokenize(self, text: str) -> list:
        # Could use more advanced tokenization with custom medical rules
        return re.findall(r"\b[\w-]+\b", text)
```

#### üìä Feature Extraction

```python
class BagOfWordsExtractor(FeatureExtractor):
    def extract_features(self, tokens: list) -> dict:
        return {token: tokens.count(token) for token in set(tokens)}

class MedicalTFIDFExtractor(FeatureExtractor):
    def extract_features(self, tokens: list) -> dict:
        # Placeholder for TF-IDF implementation
        return {"tfidf:" + t: 0.5 for t in tokens}  # dummy value
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Use Polymorphism to Chain Components

```python
def run_pipeline(text: str, cleaner: TextProcessor, tokenizer: Tokenizer, extractor: FeatureExtractor):
    cleaned = cleaner.process(text)
    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(cleaned)
    features = extractor.extract_features(tokens)
    return features
```

You can now **swap components easily**:

```python
text = "Patient PID123 has a fever and headache"

features = run_pipeline(
    text,
    cleaner=MedicalCleaner(),
    tokenizer=MedicalTokenizer(),
    extractor=MedicalTFIDFExtractor()
)

print(features)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits in Healthcare NLP:

* **Reusable**: You can use `MedicalCleaner`, `WhitespaceTokenizer`, etc., across pipelines.
* **Extendable**: Easily create `DeepLearningFeatureExtractor` or `ClinicalNoteTokenizer`.
* **Testable**: Each component is isolated for unit testing.
* **Maintainable**: You follow the Open/Closed principle ‚Äî open for extension, closed for modification.

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus Tip: Use `Pipeline` Class to Chain Steps

```python
class NLPPipeline:
    def __init__(self, cleaner, tokenizer, extractor):
        self.cleaner = cleaner
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.extractor = extractor

    def run(self, text: str):
        return self.extractor.extract_features(
            self.tokenizer.tokenize(
                self.cleaner.process(text)
            )
        )
```

Let me know if you‚Äôd like this wrapped as a Python module, or with logging, error handling, or ready for `scikit-learn`-like pipelines.
