## 6. How to Handle the Budget Constraint

### Option 1: Accept with Limited Scope
**What to say to client:**
> "I understand your budget constraint. For ₹30,000, I can deliver a basic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that includes core functionality. This will be a solid foundation that you can expand later as your business grows."

### Option 2: Phased Development Approach
**Propose to client:**
> "Let's break this into phases:
> - Phase 1 (₹30,000): Basic customer app + vendor panel
> - Phase 2 (₹25,000): iOS app + payment integration  
> - Phase 3 (₹35,000): Delivery system + advanced features
> 
> You can launch with Phase 1 and add features based on user feedback and revenue."

### Option 3: Revenue Sharing Model
**Alternative proposal:**
> "Instead of ₹30,000, let's do ₹20,000 upfront + 2% of app revenue for first 2 years. This aligns my success with yours."

## 7. What You Should NOT Compromise On

⚠️ **Non-negotiables:**
- Payment terms (never work without advance)
- Source code ownership (client gets it only after final payment)
- Scope creep protection
- Timeline realism
- Quality standards

✅ **What you can adjust:**
- Feature complexity
- Platform coverage (Android first, iOS later)
- Design sophistication
- Integration complexity
- Post-launch support duration
