## 2. Study of Architecture & System Design

### Blinkit / Zepto - Quick Commerce Apps

These apps prioritize speed and reliability in the last-mile delivery of groceries but have architectural similarities to what an interior design e-commerce/marketplace app might need:

- **Micro-warehouses (Dark Stores)** decentralize inventory to reduce delivery times
- Modular Inventory Management, Order Management, and Delivery tracking
- Multi-role system: Customer, Vendor, Delivery, Admin
- Real-time communication through Notifications and Live Chat
- AI-powered route optimization, inventory replenishment strategies

### Popular E-Commerce Architecture (Using a Headless Approach)

```mermaid
graph TD
    FE[Frontend: React Native / React.js] --> API[API Gateway]
    API --> BL[Business Logic Layer]
    BL --> CM[Commerce Modules Layer]
    CM --> DB[(Database: Product, Inventory, Orders)]
    BL --> ThirdParty[3rd Party Integrations]
    ThirdParty --> Payment(Payment Gateway)
    ThirdParty --> Notification(Notification Service)
    ThirdParty --> Search(Search & Analytics)
```

- **Frontend**: Decoupled web & mobile apps, interacting through APIs
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests securely to microservices
- **Business Logic**: Core domain services such as order, inventory, payment
- **Commerce Modules**: Modular and independently scalable components (catalog, pricing, marketing)
- **Integration Layer**: Payment gateways, notifications, search engines

### System Design Example: Blinkit Inventory Management (Simplified)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Product {
        +sku: string
        +name: string
        +price: float
    }
    class Inventory {
        +location: string
        +stock_count: int
        +reserveStock()
        +releaseStock()
    }
    class Warehouse {
        +address: string
        +inventory: Inventory
        +processOrder()
    }
    class Order {
        +id: string
        +products: List<Product>
        +status: string
        +assignWarehouse()
    }

    Order --> Product
    Warehouse --> Inventory
    Inventory --> Product
```

- Inventory is managed per warehouse (or dark store)
- Orders get assigned to nearest warehouse with available inventory
- Stock reservation prevents overselling

## 4. Summary of System Design Principles for Your App

- **Headless and Modular Architecture:** Separate frontend and backend, with loosely coupled modules for inventory, orders, notifications, chat, and delivery.
- **Multi-role Access:** Distinct interfaces for customers, vendors, delivery agents, and admins.
- **Real-time Updates:** Leveraging websockets or push notifications for instant communication and order tracking.
- **Microservices or Well-Defined Modules:** Scale individual components like inventory or chat without affecting others.
- **Scalability & Extensibility:** Cloud infrastructure with containerization to scale user base and feature set.
