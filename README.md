 AI Learning Report: Crash Course on AI in 2025 🚀
Introduction (0:00) 🌟
The video provides a comprehensive overview of AI in 2025, aimed at taking viewers from beginner to advanced levels. It covers key AI topics, offers crash courses on each, and includes resources for deeper exploration. The goal is to equip viewers with knowledge surpassing 99% of the population, with assessments to ensure retention. The video is structured to cover basic AI definitions, prompting, agents, AI-assisted coding (vibe coding), and emerging technologies for the second half of 2025.
Note: A real-world example of such educational content is platforms like Coursera or YouTube channels like "freeCodeCamp," which offer structured tech courses with quizzes to reinforce learning.

AI Basics & Terminologies (0:53) 🧠
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer programs that complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. The field has existed for decades, with traditional AI (previously called machine learning) including examples like Google search algorithms and YouTube’s recommendation system. Modern AI focuses on generative AI, a subset that generates new content like text, images, audio, video, and other media. A key type of generative AI is the large language model (LLM), which processes and outputs text. Examples include GPT from OpenAI, Gemini from Google, and Claude from Anthropic. Many models are now multimodal, handling inputs and outputs beyond text, such as images, audio, and video (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro).
Definitions

Generative AI: AI that creates new content, such as text, images, or audio.
Large Language Model (LLM): A model that processes and generates text.
Multimodal: Models that handle multiple data types (text, images, audio, video).

Note: A real-world example of generative AI is DALL·E, which creates images from text prompts, used by designers to generate concept art.

Prompt Engineering (2:30) ✍️
Prompting is the process of providing specific instructions to a generative AI tool to achieve desired outcomes, using inputs like text, images, audio, video, or code. It’s the highest return-on-investment skill for interacting with AI models, foundational for advanced AI tasks. Effective prompting ensures better communication with AI, making even advanced tools useful.
Frameworks for Prompting

Tiny Crabs Ride Enormous Iguanas (Task, Context, Resources, Evaluate, Iterate):

Task: Define what the AI should do (e.g., create an Instagram post for an octopus merch line).
Context: Provide details (e.g., company name: Lonely Octopus, mascot: Inky, target audience: 20–40-year-old professionals).
Resources: Include examples (e.g., other IG posts for inspiration).
Evaluate: Review the output and decide if it meets expectations.
Iterate: Refine the prompt to improve results.


Ramen Saves Tragic Idiots (Revisit, Separate, Try, Introduce Constraints):

Revisit: Adjust the first framework by adding/removing details.
Separate: Use shorter, clearer sentences.
Try: Rephrase or use analogous tasks (e.g., write a story instead of a speech).
Introduce Constraints: Add specific limits (e.g., only country music for a playlist).



Example Prompt

Act as an expert IG influencer. Create an IG post for my new octopus merch line by Lonely Octopus. Start with a fun fact about octopi, followed by the announcement, and end with three relevant hashtags. Include pictures of the merch featuring our mascot, Inky. Target audience: 20–40-year-old professionals. Launch date: [specific date]. Use this IG post [example link] as inspiration.

Note: A real-world example is marketing teams using AI tools like Jasper to craft social media posts, applying frameworks to ensure brand-aligned content.

Agents (9:20) 🤖
AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks autonomously on behalf of users, often mimicking specific roles (e.g., customer service or coding agents). They handle common tasks like responding to password reset emails or building MVP web applications. The field is rapidly growing, with significant investment and potential to integrate into products and businesses.
Components of AI Agents (OpenAI Framework)

AI Model: The reasoning engine.
Tools: Enable interaction with interfaces (e.g., email tools).
Knowledge and Memory: Access to databases and session history.
Audio and Speech: Natural language interaction.
Guardrails: Prevent unintended actions.
Orchestration: Deploy, monitor, and improve agents.

Multi-Agent Systems
Multiple agents with specific roles work together, similar to a company with specialized employees. This prevents a single agent from being overwhelmed. The MCP (Multi-agent Control Protocol) by Anthropic standardizes tool and knowledge access, likened to a universal USB plug.
Tools for Building Agents

No/Low-Code: n8n (general use), Gumloop (enterprise).
Code-Based: OpenAI’s Agents SDK, Google’s ADK, Claude Code SDK.

Note: A real-world example is Zendesk’s AI chatbots, which handle customer inquiries autonomously, escalating complex issues to human agents.

Vibe Coding (16:14) 💻
Vibe coding, coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, involves telling an AI what to build, and it handles the implementation. It’s a new way to incorporate AI into product development, enabled by advanced LLMs. However, best practices are crucial for usable, scalable products.
Five-Step Framework: Tiny Ferrets Carry Dangerous Code

Thinking: Define the product via a Product Requirements Document (PRD).
Frameworks: Use appropriate tools (e.g., React, Tailwind).
Checkpoints: Use version control (e.g., Git) to avoid losing progress.
Debugging: Be methodical, provide error messages/screenshots.
Context: Add mockups, examples, and detailed instructions.

Example Prompt

Create a simple React web app called Daily Vibes. Users can select a mood from a list of emojis, optionally write a short note, and submit it. Show a list of past mood entries with a date and note.

Tools for Vibe Coding

Beginner: Lovable, V0, Bolt.
Intermediate: Replet (shows codebase).
Advanced: Firebase Studio (prompting and IDE modes), Windsurf, Cursor.
Expert: Command-line tools like Cloud Code.
