## 1. Introduction: Who is Thomas Wolf?

Thomas Wolf is the **co-founder and Chief Science Officer of Hugging Face**, an open-source platform that's really shaping the future of AI. The interview was conducted at Vivitech, focusing on how AI will impact the future of work, essential skills, and the timeline for home robots.

## 2. Hugging Face Explained: The "App Store for AI"

### For Technical Users
* Hugging Face is primarily designed for **software developers** who want to build AI applications.
* The platform offers:
    * **Models:** Pre-trained AI models for various tasks.
    * **Datasets:** Data to train or fine-tune AI models.
* It's a great **open-source alternative** to closed solutions like OpenAI or Anthropic, giving developers full control over their stack. Users can find and download models suitable for their applications.

### For Non-Technical Users: Hugging Face Spaces
* A rapidly growing and more accessible part of Hugging Face is **AI Apps**, also known as **"Spaces."**
* **Concept:** It's like an "App Store of AI," where users can find small, community-created websites (apps) to perform AI-powered tasks.
* **How to use:**
    1.  Go to Hugging Face Spaces.
    2.  Use the search bar to type what you want to do with AI (e.g., "remove background of image," "text-to-speech," "generate 3D character from image," "generate image from prompt like Midjourney").
    3.  Select an app created by the community.
    4.  Use a simple, low-code button interface to perform the "magical" AI tasks.
* **Flexibility:**
    * These apps can be used directly on the Hugging Face platform (which provides the compute).
    * Users can also **"git clone" and download** these spaces to run them offline on their own powerful PCs, depending on the AI model's size.
* **Example:** There's a popular **"VI Vibe coding space"** called **Deep Sight** (using the free Chinese DeepSeek model), which runs locally, ensuring privacy for user prompts.

### Ownership of Open-Source AI Generations
* **Analogy to Code:** Thomas Wolf explains ownership through the lens of open-source code.
* **Open-Source Principle:** When code is shared with an open-source license (like **MIT or Apache**), users can generally use and modify it.
* **Attribution:** The main requirement is usually to **credit the original creator** of the code, not to take credit for their work.
* **Commercial Use:** More complex licenses might require payment for commercial applications.
* **The Dilemma:** Just like creators of foundational software (e.g., Linux, NumPy, PyTorch) don't always earn a significant fraction of the value generated from their work, AI creators might face similar challenges.
* **Motivation:** Many open-source creators are driven by the mission to make technology freely accessible.
* **Open Core Model:** A business model where a core base is open-source, but advanced features (e.g., security, business integration) are kept private and monetized. This makes sense as businesses using these features are likely generating revenue themselves.

## 3. Sponsor Break: HubSpot's AI Agents Playbook
* HubSpot has released a new guide, "The Playbook for Success in 2025 about AI Agents," to help businesses implement AI agents.
* **Content:**
    * **Marketing:** AI agents for content creation, social posts, campaign analytics.
    * **Sales:** AI agents for prep, research, meeting notes, follow-ups.
    * **Operations (Ops):** AI agents for organizing tasks, automating admin, real-time insights.
* **Actionable Plan:** The guide provides a clear plan for selecting tools, setting them up, and getting results.
* **HubSpot AI Startup Pitch Competition:** Thomas Wolf will be judging a competition at Inbound in September in San Francisco. The winner gets $50,000 cash. Applications close July 25th.

## 4. The Future of Coding and AI
* **Impact on Non-Technical Individuals:**
    * Many non-technical people (e.g., entrepreneurs with business backgrounds) are already using AI "vibe coding" tools to create apps and prototypes.
    * AI tools enable non-technical users to build technically complex products.
* **Impact on New Generation of Coders:**
    * Kids are learning to code differently: they use AI tools to generate code, then dive into the code only when something doesn't work. This is a contrast to traditional structured learning.
    * While the learning method is different, the end result isn't necessarily "less technical."
* **The Need for More Developers:** Despite AI's capabilities, Thomas believes the developer pool will actually grow, as the limitations of current tools still necessitate human coding skills.

## 5. Raising Kids in the AI Age: Fostering Creativity
* **Timeless Values:** Thomas emphasizes the importance of timeless values, especially **creativity**, in the age of AI.
* **AI's Limitation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are great at predicting the "most likely next token" and generating expected content, but they are **not good at truly novel creation**.
* **Human Creativity:** Humans still need to invent things that are "out of the ordinary" to stand out.
* **Teaching Creativity:**
    * Countries like Sweden (e.g., Spotify, Klarna founders) have a strong focus on creativity in their education system.
    * The French system, for example, is more focused on learning prescribed lists rather than fostering independent creative thought.
* **Parental Guidance for Coding:**
    * Directly pushing kids to code can be counterproductive.
    * Instead, **"open their horizon"** by showing them possibilities and tools, letting them explore what they find interesting and fun.
    * Example: Taking his son to an entrepreneur conference sparked interest naturally.

## 6. Robots in Everyday Life
* **Near Future:** The world in 5-10 years will be "very different" due to AI automation, though human interaction (e.g., talking, podcasts) will likely remain.
* **Hugging Face's Foray into Robotics:** Hugging Face recently acquired a robotics company.
    * **Goal:** To make accessible robots, primarily for developers, but also simple enough for kids to learn robotics.
    * **Value:** Robots give a "physical presence to AI," making it more tangible than just voice assistants like Alexa.
* **The Open-Source Robotics Ecosystem:**
    * Users can **teach things to their robots** and then **upload them to Hugging Face** to share with others in an open-source manner.
    * This creates a growing repository of capabilities, meaning robots aren't limited to a fixed set of functions (e.g., cooking, playing, cleaning robots whose skills grow over time).
    * It's envisioned as a "future Apple store" for robots, where devices have a physical form, and users can download and tailor apps for them.
* **Timeline for Household Robots & Cost:**
    * **Technology:** The core technology is "very close," with prototyping and demos possible as early as **next year (2026)**.
    * **Main Challenges:** **Price and regulation.**
    * **Early Cost:** Initial consumer robots (especially humanoids with grasping hands) are expected to cost around **$15,000 - $20,000** (price of a car). Subscriptions are also a possibility for expensive models.
    * **Form Factors:** Not all robots need to be humanoids. Hugging Face is exploring various forms (single arm, moving head, no arms, robot ducks) to find the best balance of price, possibility, and capabilities.
* **Privacy and Safety Concerns:**
    * **Open Source Advantage:** A key benefit of open-source models and robots is the ability to **download and run them locally**.
        * You can turn off Wi-Fi, ensuring the robot or AI model cannot send data externally, thus protecting privacy. This is not possible with closed-source solutions like ChatGPT.
    * **Safety:** Safety is paramount for robots, unlike language models. A robot "punching something" is far more serious than an AI generating "bad words."
    * **Autonomy:** Robots need to function reliably even when disconnected from the internet (e.g., if Wi-Fi stops, a robot loading a dishwasher should not just drop items).
    * **Strong privacy** is essential for devices in one's home.

## 7. AI's Impact: Beyond Chatbots & Unemployment

### Near-Term AI Trends (Next Year - 2026)
1.  **AI Agents:** Expect to see widespread AI agents capable of automating complex tasks on computers.
2.  **Robots in Physical World:** Robots will begin performing significant tasks in the physical world, a trend that will continue to grow.
3.  **Photorealistic Content at Scale:** Indistinguishable video and sound content will become commonplace, raising questions about reality. Thomas hopes this will lead to people valuing real-life, face-to-face interactions more.

### The "AI + Science" Vision (5 Years)
* Thomas's most exciting direction for AI is applying AI models and techniques to other scientific research fields for fundamental breakthroughs.
* **Examples:**
    * Discovering **new materials** for batteries.
    * Improving **weather prediction**.
    * Advancements in **fusion energy**.
    * Potentially solving some **diseases** (though cancer is complex).
* **Focus:** "AI plus science" is about taking smart AI models and applying their knowledge to scientific fields to solve "big, big challenges" like climate change (e.g., smarter batteries, carbon dioxide trapping).

### Addressing Mass Unemployment
* **Optimistic View (Entrepreneurship):** AI makes many things accessible, enabling more people (even kids) to become entrepreneurs and create products/companies (e.g., a website to share cats, connecting amateur football players with scouts).
* **Concern (Job Disruption):**
    * Fields requiring long studies (e.g., law, especially intellectual property, which Thomas was a part of) will face **strong disruption** as AI handles many support functions.
    * People who have studied for 5-8 years for such jobs cannot easily jump to new fields.
    * This "big job disruption" is a definite concern for the next five years.
* **Governments' Role:** Very few governments or think tanks are actively tackling this issue, often preferring to focus on the abstract danger of AGI.

### Advice for Those Facing Job Disruption
1.  **Become a Master of AI Tools:** Actively use and understand AI tools to integrate them into your profession. Don't ignore the revolution.
2.  **Re-evaluate Your Job:** Use these tools to see what remains the "exciting part" of your job. If you're no longer happy, consider creating or starting something new.
* **Societal Challenge:** The question of mass unemployment when not everyone wants to be an entrepreneur is a societal issue that needs to be addressed by governments (e.g., potentially through universal basic income).
* **Potential Future:** A future society heavily focused on entertainment is a possibility.
* **Humanity's Loss:** A concern is whether automating too much of life will lead to a loss of "being human" (e.g., relying on GPS means losing the ability to navigate a city mentally).

## 8. Key Takeaways & Concluding Thoughts

* **AI will be diffused everywhere:** Expect smaller, high-performance AI models embedded in everyday electronics, making our devices understand us better.
* **AI + Science is the real game-changer:** While chatbots are useful, the true transformative power of AI lies in its application to scientific research to solve humanity's biggest challenges (e.g., climate change, diseases, new materials).
* **Job disruption is a near-term reality:** This needs immediate societal and governmental attention, not just discussions about hypothetical AGI risks.
* **Embrace AI tools and creativity:** Individuals must learn to leverage AI tools and foster their innate creativity, as these will be crucial skills in an AI-driven future.
* **The human element remains vital:** Despite automation, human interaction and the value of "being together in the same room" may become even more precious in a world filled with synthetic content.
