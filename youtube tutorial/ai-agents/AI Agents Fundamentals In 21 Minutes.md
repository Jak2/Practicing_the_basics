# AI Agents in 2025: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Building & Using Them ü§ñ

Learn AI agents fast with this concise guide! I‚Äôve distilled weeks of research‚Äîthree courses, 200+ pages of notes, and hands-on experience‚Äîinto the essentials. Understand what AI agents are, explore multi-agent systems, build one with no code, and discover business opportunities. Pass the quiz at the end to confirm your knowledge!

## Video Overview (0:38) üìã  
**What‚Äôs Covered**:  
- Define AI agents and their workflows.  
- Crash course on multi-agent design patterns.  
- Build a no-code AI agent workflow.  
- Tips to use AI agents for business.  
- End with a quiz to test your understanding.

## AI Agents Definition (1:15) üß†  
**What Are AI Agents?**  
AI agents break tasks into iterative steps for better results, unlike one-shot prompting.  
- **Non-Agentic**: One prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúWrite an essay on topic X‚Äù)‚Äîvague output.  
- **Agentic Workflow**: Circular process (e.g., outline, research, draft, revise).  
- **Autonomous AI Agent**: Fully independent task handling (not yet common in 2025).

## Agentic Design Patterns (3:46) üîÑ  
**Four Key Patterns (by Andrew Ng)**:  
1. **Reflection**: AI reviews its own work (e.g., checks code for errors).  
2. **Tool Use**: AI uses tools like web search or code execution (e.g., find the best coffee maker or calculate compound interest).  
3. **Planning & Reasoning**: AI maps steps and tools for a task (e.g., generate an image and describe it via audio).  
4. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Multiple AIs collaborate, each with specialized roles, for better results.  
*Mnemonic*: Red Turtles Paint Murals (Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, Multi-Agent).  
**Examples**: AI research assistants, writers, coders, and personal assistants.

## Multi-Agent Design Patterns (9:25) ü§ù  
**Single AI Agent Components (Mnemonic: Tired Alpacas Mix Tea)**:  
- **Task**: What to do (e.g., plan a 3-day Tokyo trip).  
- **Answer**: Desired output (e.g., itinerary with bookings).  
- **Model**: AI model used (e.g., Anthropic‚Äôs Claude).  
- **Tools**: Tools needed (e.g., Google Maps, Skyscanner).  

**Multi-Agent Patterns (from Crew AI Course)**:  
1. **Sequential**: Agents work in a line (e.g., document processing: extract, summarize, save).  
2. **Hierarchical**: Manager agent oversees sub-agents (e.g., business report: sub-agents track trends, sentiment, metrics).  
3. **Hybrid**: Combines sequential and hierarchical with feedback loops (e.g., autonomous vehicles: route planning, sensor fusion).  
4. **Parallel**: Agents work simultaneously (e.g., large-scale data analysis).  
5. **Asynchronous**: Agents work independently at different times (e.g., cybersecurity threat detection).  
*Note*: Complexity increases chaos, similar to human organizations.

## Building a No-Code Agent in n8n (17:05) üõ†Ô∏è  
**Example: Telegram AI Assistant (Inky Bot)**  
- **Function**: Prioritizes tasks, accesses Google Calendar, and schedules events.  
- **Setup (via n8n, no code)**:  
  1. **Trigger**: Telegram message (text or voice).  
  2. **Process**: Voice input transcribed via Open AI; text fed to AI agent.  
  3. **Agent Specs**:  
     - Task: Create a prioritized to-do list.  
     - Answer: List + scheduled events.  
     - Model: Open AI GPT-4o Mini (or others like Claude).  
     - Tools: Read/create Google Calendar events.  
  4. **Output**: Communicates via Telegram (e.g., on Feb 5, 2025, lists tasks like filming a video).

## Ways to Use AI Agents (19:47) üí°  
**Business Opportunity (from Y Combinator)**:  
- For every SaaS company (e.g., Adobe, Salesforce, Canva), there‚Äôs a potential AI agent company.  
- **Action**: Pick a SaaS company, then build an AI agent version of it.  
**Why It Works**: AI agents can replicate and enhance SaaS functionalities, creating new business verticals.
