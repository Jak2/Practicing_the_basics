# üìã Guide to Crafting a Prompt for a Documented Report-Style Response

To get a response like the one I provided‚Äîstructured as a documented report with a table of contents, chapters, Mermaid flow diagrams for each topic, and formatted content with bullet points, numbering, and emojis‚Äîfollow the steps below to create your prompt. Here's a sample prompt with headings to help you structure your request.

## 1. Specify the Desired Output Format üìÑ

Clearly state that you want the response in a "documented report" format, organized like a book with a table of contents and chapters. Mention that each chapter should cover a specific topic.

**Prompt Example**:
- I want the response formatted as a documented report, structured like a book with a table of contents and chapters. Each chapter should focus on a specific topic from the content I provide.

## 2. Request Mermaid Flow Diagrams for Each Topic üîÑ

Ask for a Mermaid flow diagram at the beginning of each chapter to visually outline the flow of the topic. Specify that these diagrams should be embedded within the chapter as code snippets, not as separate files.

**Prompt Example**:
- At the start of each chapter, include a Mermaid flow diagram in a code snippet box to explain the complete flow of the topic. Do not create separate files for the flow diagrams; embed them within the chapter.

## 3. Define the Content Structure and Formatting üìë

Request that the content within each chapter uses proper formatting, including headings, bullet points, numbering, and emojis where appropriate. Mention that timestamps should only appear in chapter headings, not in the content itself.

**Prompt Example**:
- Within each chapter, use proper formatting with headings, bullet points, numbering, and emojis for clarity and engagement. Include timestamps only in the chapter headings, not in the content.

## 4. Provide the Content to Structure üìú

Share the content you want to be organized into the report. This could be a transcript, a list of topics, or any material you want structured. Be clear about what content to include or exclude.

**Prompt Example**:
- Here is the content I want you to structure into the report: [Insert transcript or content here]. Exclude any sections related to [specific topics to exclude, e.g., followers, live streams]. Organize the content into chapters based on the main topics discussed.

## 5. Specify Any Additional Preferences üõ†Ô∏è

If you have any additional preferences, such as tone, specific details to emphasize, or exclusions, mention them clearly.

**Prompt Example**:
- Use a professional yet engaging tone, similar to a teacher explaining concepts to a student. Emphasize key concepts with bold text and ensure the report is easy to follow for beginners.

## Tips for Best Results üåü

- **Be Specific**: Clearly define the content and topics you want to cover.
- **Exclude Unwanted Content**: Mention any sections to exclude to keep the report focused.
- **Test and Refine**: If the response isn‚Äôt exactly what you want, tweak the prompt by adding more details or clarifying your preferences.

By using a prompt like the one above, you can ensure I respond in the same structured, documented report style with Mermaid flow diagrams and engaging formatting. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to adjust this further! üìò
