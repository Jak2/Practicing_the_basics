## The Underground Job Market (0:23) 🕵️  
**Context**: Emily notes the job market is bad, scary, and likely not improving. The tea? Up to 80% of jobs are filled via the underground job market—referrals and word of mouth.  
- **Details**: People you see on LinkedIn landing roles often knew someone, had a “plug,” or heard about jobs pre-posting. That high school acquaintance in your dream job? They likely pulled strings.  
- **Takeaway**: Tap into this secret network to bypass the chaos of traditional job hunting.

## Do This Weekly (1:04) ☕  
**Context**: Emily insists this habit works for everyone—students or pros—and beats the grind of daily job applications.  
- **Habit**: Have a coffee chat with one person from a company you want to work at (current or target employer) every single week.  
- **Reality Check**: Yes, it’s time-consuming, but so is applying for months without replies. Pick your struggle!  
- **How**: Start small, stay consistent, and watch the magic unfold.

## Start with Someone (1:29) 👥  
**Context**: Even with no connections, Emily guides you to kick off easily.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Begin with someone you know—family, friends, professors, or peers in the industry. Ask for intros if needed.  
  - If your circle’s dry, hit LinkedIn: search your ideal job title (e.g., finance manager, senior marketing manager) at target companies in your city.  
  - Expect 1 response per 10-12 messages—cold outreach is a numbers game.  
- **Approach**: Reach out, aiming for a 20-minute chat focused 1000% on them (more on that next).

## Focus is 1000 (2:13) 🎙️  
**Context**: Emily admits we all love talking about ourselves (cue her camera chat), making this strategy gold.  
- **Method**:  
  - Introduce yourself briefly: “I’m Emily, a finance student, fascinated by your KPMG growth—can I hear more about your journey?”  
  - Prepare 3-5 tailored questions (e.g., “What were your key learnings moving from analyst to director?” or “Any advice for a starter like me?”).  
  - Keep it all about them—flatter their ego, absorb their insights.  
- **Why**: People respond better when it’s not a job pitch; you’re just curious.

## Call to Action (3:00) 📞  
**Context**: Emily teases a life-changing trick post-chat.  
- **Endgame**:  
  - If the vibe’s off, say “Thanks, appreciate it,” and move on—no follow-up needed.  
  - If it clicked, say: “Thanks so much for your time, I’d love to stay in touch. Anyone else in your network I should connect with?”  
- **Follow-Through**: Wait a few hours, then email: “Thanks again, let’s book a call in a month. Any network connections for me?” They’ll likely suggest colleagues.

## Keepworm Strategy (4:04) 🌱  
**Context**: Emily explains how this builds a self-sustaining network over months.  
- **Plan**:  
  - After 2-3 months, have 10-15 contacts. Don’t call weekly—touch base every couple of months if it fits, or just message monthly.  
  - Stay friendly (work-appropriate): Ask how they’re doing, follow up on past chats, or share an article.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - You stay top of mind for job openings.  
  - Track their company’s postings; when a role pops up, message: “Hey, noticed this role—know who’s recruiting?” They might refer you.  
  - Creep their LinkedIn connections for more leads, asking, “Know anyone at this company? I’d love to learn about this role.”

## Networking (5:03) 🤝  
**Context**: Emily reflects on missing this early, losing jobs to someone’s friend, and pushes for proactive relationship-building.  
- **Tip**: Attend industry networking events, not just career fairs (too competitive now).  
- **Why**: Casual settings foster allies and friends, not stiff corporate vibes.  
- **Long Game**: Build relationships over time—proactivity could’ve made her “the friend” who got hired.
